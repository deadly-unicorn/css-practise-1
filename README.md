## Personal Project
This project has the goal of me practising TailwindCSS, reviewing some simple ReactJS and also learn and exercise on the Framer-Motion library.
### Please, for any issues contant me directly and I'll try to resolve them.
I am basically just practising CSS layouts by getting as a reference a website (https://turbo.build/). That doesn't mean I have any relation to that website, or anything related to the organization owning it.
